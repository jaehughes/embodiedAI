## Embodied and Emergent AI Tool Kit
 
To introduce embodied and emergent AI, we provide a number of toolkits, activities and platforms that introduce a number of related concepts.  These vary in scope, for initial activities for school-aged students, through to more open ended research projects for university students and researchers.

* *Hot-Glue Soft Robots.* Explore the use of HotGlue to rapid design and iterate on robots.   [Click here](hotglue.md) for the activity
* Paper Falling
* Plantoids
* MatLAB swarm behaviour activities
